<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Durrell Jordan Rankins and I am from Omaha, Nebraska  but now currently residing in the Dallas/ Fort Worth area. I am a father to one son and his name is Durrell as well but we call him DJ.
  I am looking to start a career in web developement, software developement, and/or engineering. I have an IT background after working as an IT analyst for 4 years. I completed my Cybersecurity Analyst Certification in August of 2022 and I am completing "The Complete 2024 Web developement Bootcamp"
  where I learned HTML, CSS, Javascript, Node, React, PostgreSQL, Web3 and DApps. My desire to be better grows everyday. I enjoy learning new things that I can apply to my skill set and just staying up to date with any new changes.

<p>My first experience with coding was in a class I took my sophomore year of high school where we were instructed to create a band and a website for the band. At that point, I was intrigued for the whole project. Over the years, I got away from the idea of coding and tried my hand in other things but in recent times, it came back full circle to regain that
  love for coding.</p>
